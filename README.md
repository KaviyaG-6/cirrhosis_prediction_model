# cirrhosis_prediction_model
Objective : To predict whether the disease is in stage 4 or not.
Implementation : 
The data was pre-processed to ensure it was suitable for analysis. I then performed a comparative analysis of three classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes. To evaluate their performance, I visualized the accuracy of each model, which provided clear insights into how effectively each algorithm predicted the stage of cirrhosis.
